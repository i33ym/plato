# Plato: Data Structures & Algorithms in Go

A systematic learning repository and refresher for myself. Each package is really self-contained with implementations, examples and tests

## Learning Path

### Foundations
- **Arrays**: Slices
- **Sorting**: Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Quick, Heap, Merge
- **Searching**: Linear, Binary

### Data Structures
- **Linked-List**: Singly, Doubly
- **Tree**: BST, Traversals, Balancing
- **Heap**: Min, Max
- **Graph**: DFS, BFS, Topological Sorting

### Dynamic Programming
- **Classic Problems**
- **Greedy Algorithms**
